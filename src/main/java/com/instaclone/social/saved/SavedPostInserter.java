 * Runs the save-post insert attempt in its own transaction (REQUIRES_NEW) so a losing

 * HashtagCreator's reasoning exactly: on Postgres a failed statement poisons the entire enclosing
 * transaction, so catching the constraint violation has to happen outside the transaction that hit
 * it. Has to be its own bean, not a private method on SavedPostService, since Spring can't apply
 * REQUIRES_NEW to a self-invoked call.
